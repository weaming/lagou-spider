## Get Start

$ npm install && npm start
```

Then, spider will begin to grap info from lagou. If u want grap other jobs, just modify the `config.js` file and rerun

## What if failure

If u get failure while graping info by network error and so on. Just **rerun `npm start`**, all that graped will be cached in `.tmp` folder.
